It is generally favorable to only run the tests of interest rather than running all available benchmarks. Also note that JMH benchmarks run within the same JVM as the system-under-test, so results might vary between runs.
Running Benchmarks on GitHub It is possible to run one or more Benchmarks via the JMH Benchmarks GH action on your own fork of the Iceberg repo.</description></item><item><title>How To Release</title><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/how-to-release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/how-to-release/</guid><description>Setup To create a release candidate, you will need:

The community continuously improves Iceberg core library components to enable integrations with different compute engines that power analytics, business intelligence, machine learning, etc. Connectors for Spark, Flink and Hive are maintained in the main Iceberg repository.
Multi-Version Support Processing engine connectors maintained in the iceberg repository are built for multiple versions.</description></item><item><title>Roadmap</title><link>https://iceberg.apache.org/roadmap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iceberg.apache.org/roadmap/</guid><description>Roadmap Overview This roadmap outlines projects that the Iceberg community is working on, their priority, and a rough size estimate.
